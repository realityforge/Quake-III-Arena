//  Synchronization of access to resources is primarily the responsibility
//  of the application in Vulkan. The order of execution of commands with
//  respect to the host and other commands on the device has few implicit
//  guarantees, and needs to be explicitly specified. Memory caches and
//  other optimizations are also explicitly managed, requiring that the
//  flow of data through the system is largely under application control.
//  Whilst some implicit guarantees exist between commands, five explicit
//  synchronization mechanisms are exposed by Vulkan:
//
//
//                          Fences
//
//  Fences can be used to communicate to the host that execution of some
//  task on the device has completed.
//
//  Fences are a synchronization primitive that can be used to insert a
//  dependency from a queue to the host. Fences have two states - signaled and
//  unsignaled. A fence can be signaled as part of the execution of a queue
//  submission command. Fences can be unsignaled on the host with vkResetFences.
//  Fences can be waited on by the host with the vkWaitForFences command, and
//  the current state can be queried with vkGetFenceStatus.
//
//
//                          Semaphores
//
//  Semaphores can be used to control resource access across multiple queues.
//
//                          Events
//
//  Events provide a fine-grained synchronization primitive which can be
//  signaled either within a command buffer or by the host, and can be
//  waited upon within a command buffer or queried on the host.
//
//                          Pipeline Barriers
//
//  Pipeline barriers also provide synchronization control within a command
//  buffer, but at a single point, rather than with separate signal and wait
//  operations.
//
//                          Render Passes
//
//  Render passes provide a useful synchronization framework for most rendering
//  tasks, built upon the concepts in this chapter. Many cases that would
//  otherwise need an application to use other synchronization primitives can be
//  expressed more efficiently as part of a render pass.
//

/*
   Use of a presentable image must occur only after the image is
   returned by vkAcquireNextImageKHR, and before it is presented by
   vkQueuePresentKHR. This includes transitioning the image layout
   and rendering commands.


   The presentation engine is an abstraction for the platform¡¯s compositor
   or display engine. The presentation engine controls the order in which
   presentable images are acquired for use by the application.

   This allows the platform to handle situations which require out-of-order
   return of images after presentation. At the same time, it allows the
   application to generate command buffers referencing all of the images in
   the swapchain at initialization time, rather than in its main loop.

   Host access to fence must be externally synchronized.

   When a fence is submitted to a queue as part of a queue submission command,
   it defines a memory dependency on the batches that were submitted as part
   of that command, and defines a fence signal operation which sets the fence
   to the signaled state.

  //
  // An attachment description describes the properties of an attachment
  // including its format, sample count, and how its contents are treated
  // at the beginning and end of each render pass instance.
  //
  // A subpass represents a phase of rendering that reads and writes
  // a subset of the attachments in a render pass. Rendering commands
  // are recorded into a particular subpass of a render pass instance.
  //
  // A subpass description describes the subset of attachments that
  // is involved in the execution of a subpass. Each subpass can read
  // from some attachments as input attachments, write to some as
  // color attachments or depth/stencil attachments, and perform
  // multisample resolve operations to resolve attachments. A subpass
  // description can also include a set of preserve attachments,
  // which are attachments that are not read or written by the subpass
  // but whose contents must be preserved throughout the subpass.
  //
  // A subpass uses an attachment if the attachment is a color,
  // depth/stencil, resolve, or input attachment for that subpass
  // (as determined by the pColorAttachments, pDepthStencilAttachment,
  // pResolveAttachments, and pInputAttachments members of
  // VkSubpassDescription, respectively). A subpass does not use an
  // attachment if that attachment is preserved by the subpass.
  // The first use of an attachment is in the lowest numbered subpass
  // that uses that attachment. Similarly, the last use of an attachment
  // is in the highest numbered subpass that uses that attachment.
  //
  // The subpasses in a render pass all render to the same dimensions,
  // and fragments for pixel (x,y,layer) in one subpass can only read
  // attachment contents written by previous subpasses at that same
  // (x,y,layer) location.
  //
  // By describing a complete set of subpasses in advance, render passes
  // provide the implementation an opportunity to optimize the storage
  // and transfer of attachment data between subpasses. In practice,
  // this means that subpasses with a simple framebuffer-space dependency
  // may be merged into a single tiled rendering pass, keeping the
  // attachment data on-chip for the duration of a render pass instance.
  // However, it is also quite common for a render pass to only contain
  // a single subpass.
  //
  // Subpass dependencies describe execution and memory dependencies
  // between subpasses. A subpass dependency chain is a sequence of
  // subpass dependencies in a render pass, where the source subpass
  // of each subpass dependency (after the first) equals the destination
  // subpass of the previous dependency.
  //
  // Execution of subpasses may overlap or execute out of order with
  // regards to other subpasses, unless otherwise enforced by an
  // execution dependency. Each subpass only respects submission order
  // for commands recorded in the same subpass, and the vkCmdBeginRenderPass
  // and vkCmdEndRenderPass commands that delimit the render pass -
  // commands within other subpasses are not included. This affects
  // most other implicit ordering guarantees.

  // independent of any specific image views for the attachments.

  // that the framebuffer is compatible with (see Render Pass Compatibility).
  // Collectively, a render pass and a framebuffer define the complete
  // render target state for one or more subpasses as well as the
  // algorithmic dependencies between the subpasses.
  //
  // The various pipeline stages of the drawing commands for a given
  // subpass may execute concurrently and/or out of order, both within
  // and across drawing commands, whilst still respecting pipeline order.
