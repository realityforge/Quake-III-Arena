//  ===============  Command Buffer Lifecycle ====================
// Each command buffer is always in one of the following states:
//
// Initial
//
// When a command buffer is allocated, it is in the initial state. Some commands
// are able to reset a command buffer, or a set of command buffers, back to this
// state from any of the executable, recording or invalid state. Command buffers
// in the initial state can only be moved to the recording state, or freed.
//
// Recording
//
// vkBeginCommandBuffer changes the state of a command buffer from the initial
// state to the recording state. Once a command buffer is in the recording
// state, vkCmd* commands can be used to record to the command buffer.
//
// Executable
//
// vkEndCommandBuffer ends the recording of a command buffer, and moves it from
// the recording state to the executable state. Executable command buffers can
// be submitted, reset, or recorded to another command buffer.
//
// Pending
//
// Queue submission of a command buffer changes the state of a command buffer
// from the executable state to the pending state. Whilst in the pending state,
// applications must not attempt to modify the command buffer in any way - as
// the device may be processing the commands recorded to it. Once execution of a
// command buffer completes, the command buffer reverts back to either the
// executable state, or the invalid state if it was recorded with
// VK_COMMAND_BUFFER_USAGE_ONE_TIME_SUBMIT_BIT. A synchronization command should
// be used to detect when this occurs.
//
// Invalid
//
// Some operations, such as modifying or deleting a resource that was used in a
// command recorded to a command buffer, will transition the state of that
// command buffer into the invalid state. Command buffers in the invalid state
// can only be reset or freed.
//
// Any given command that operates on a command buffer has its own requirements
// on what state a command buffer must be in, which are detailed in the valid
// usage constraints for that command.
//
// Resetting a command buffer is an operation that discards any previously
// recorded commands and puts a command buffer in the initial state. Resetting
// occurs as a result of vkResetCommandBuffer or vkResetCommandPool, or as part
// of vkBeginCommandBuffer (which additionally puts the command buffer in the
// recording state).
//
// Secondary command buffers can be recorded to a primary command buffer via
// vkCmdExecuteCommands. This partially ties the lifecycle of the two command
// buffers together - if the primary is submitted to a queue, both the primary
// and any secondaries recorded to it move to the pending state. Once execution
// of the primary completes, so does any secondary recorded within it, and once
// all executions of each command buffer complete, they move to the executable
// state. If a secondary moves to any other state whilst it is recorded to
// another command buffer, the primary moves to the invalid state. A primary
// moving to any other state does not affect the state of the secondary.
// Resetting or freeing a primary command buffer removes the linkage to any
// secondary command buffers that were recorded to it.
//

void vk_create_command_pool(VkCommandPool *pPool) {
  // Command pools are opaque objects that command buffer memory is allocated
  // from, and which allow the implementation to amortize the cost of resource
  // creation across multiple command buffers. Command pools are externally
  // synchronized, meaning that a command pool must not be used concurrently in
  // multiple threads. That includes use via recording commands on any command
  // buffers allocated from the pool, as well as operations that allocate, free,
  // and reset command buffers or the pool itself.

  // be reset or freed in a relatively short timeframe. This flag may be
  // used by the implementation to control memory allocation behavior
  // within the pool.
  //
  // VK_COMMAND_POOL_CREATE_RESET_COMMAND_BUFFER_BIT allows any command
  // buffer allocated from a pool to be individually reset to the initial
  // state; either by calling vkResetCommandBuffer, or via the implicit
  // reset when calling vkBeginCommandBuffer. If this flag is not set on
  // a pool, then vkResetCommandBuffer must not be called for any command
  // buffer allocated from that pool.

  // Command buffers are objects used to record commands which can be
  // subsequently submitted to a device queue for execution. There are
  // two levels of command buffers:
  // - primary command buffers, which can execute secondary command buffers,
  //   and which are submitted to queues.
  // - secondary command buffers, which can be executed by primary command
  // buffers,
  //   and which are not directly submitted to queues.
  //
  // Recorded commands include commands to bind pipelines and descriptor sets
  // to the command buffer, commands to modify dynamic state, commands to draw
  // (for graphics rendering), commands to dispatch (for compute), commands to
  // execute secondary command buffers (for primary command buffers only),
  // commands to copy buffers and images, and other commands.
  //
  // Each command buffer manages state independently of other command buffers.
  // There is no inheritance of state across primary and secondary command
  // buffers, or between secondary command buffers.
  //
  // When a command buffer begins recording, all state in that command buffer is
  // undefined. When secondary command buffer(s) are recorded to execute on a
  // primary command buffer, the secondary command buffer inherits no state from
  // the primary command buffer, and all state of the primary command buffer is
  // undefined after an execute secondary command buffer command is recorded.
  // There is one exception to this rule - if the primary command buffer is
  // inside a render pass instance, then the render pass and subpass state is
  // not disturbed by executing secondary command buffers. Whenever the state of
  // a command buffer is undefined, the application must set all relevant state
  // on the command buffer before any state dependent commands such as draws and
  // dispatches are recorded, otherwise the behavior of executing that command
  // buffer is undefined.
  //
  // Unless otherwise specified, and without explicit synchronization, the
  // various commands submitted to a queue via command buffers may execute in
  // arbitrary order relative to each other, and/or concurrently. Also, the
  // memory side-effects of those commands may not be directly visible to other
  // commands without explicit memory dependencies. This is true within a
  // command buffer, and across command buffers submitted to a given queue. See
  // the synchronization chapter for information on implicit and explicit
  // synchronization between commands.
