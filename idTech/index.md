# idTech

This section contains notes and references to aid the eager developer work with the idTech game engines. The `idTech` engines were created by `id Software` and are typically given a number to indicate the generation. i.e. `idTech 2` or `idTech 7`. They may also be named according to the flagship games that the engines were developed to support. (i.e. `idTech 3` is often referred to as the `Quake III Arena Engine` while `idTech 4` is referred to as the `Doom III Engine`).
