Welcome to one of the numerous Quake III Arena Source code repository forks! This is (probably) not the repository you are looking for! The goal of this project is to help the author learn the ins and outs of developing games. In the past the author completed most of a PhD around network infrastructure for games and simulations before switching topics, and he wants a platform to experiment with new ideas that have been bubbling around in his mind.

This page exists purely as a mechanism for the author to document plans and track their own progress over time. The Quake III Arena source code can be considered a relatively large, legacy codebase and the author had limited knowledge about the product before commencing work. If there is a useful product that comes out of this work then this set of documents will provide insight in what it takes to pick up and evolve a legacy product.
